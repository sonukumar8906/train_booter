<p>Travelling across the country is now easier than ever because of the complete digitization of the IRCTC ticketing procedure. Now, you can book train tickets online from the comfort of your home.

                <h3>How to Book Train Tickets</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="ticket_par">
<p>It is extremely easy to book train tickets on IRCTC. 

    Below, we are mentioning the steps that you can follow to make your bookings quickly.
    
    Step 1: Choose the source of your journey and the destination to get your train tickets book. Select the date on which you wish to start the journey 
    
    Step 2: Now, you will have a list of trains based on your destination and source. You have to choose the one you want to book tickets for. 
    
    Step 3: Filter and select the seat class. You can choose from a wide variety of options such as sleeper, seater, first-class AC, second-class AC and third-class AC. 
    
    Step 4: Select your boarding point. Enter the berth preferences and passenger details. There can be multiple passengers, and you will have to enter the details of each person separately. 
    
    Step 5: Enter the necessary contact details including email and mobile number as your e-ticket and m-ticket will be sent on the registered information. 
    
    Step 6: Select the additional preferences. For example, you can make your bookings only if the seats are available or you can specifically book the lower berth or window seat. 
    
    Step 7: Once you have filled all the above-stated details, choose the payment mode that is most convenient for you. You can choose from a wide range of options such as debit card, credit card, net banking and UPI payments. 
    
    Step 8: Enter the User ID and password of your IRCTC accounts. You will soon be redirected to the final page, and your tickets will be confirmed. Soon, you will receive your ticket on your email ID and mobile. 
    
    As you can see, the process is immensely easy, and it’s much better than spending hours just waiting in front of the railway ticket counter for your turn. Besides that, when you book train tickets online, services such as PNR enquiry and live status tracking are easily accessible. If you are using GoIbibo for ticket booking, the procedure is pretty much the same. You will notice that having a valid IRCTC account is mandatory for you to be eligible for making your railway ticket booking on GoIbibo.  </p>
